## Backup Talking Points

### If They Ask About AI:
> "We use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API, but it also supports local LLMs through node-llama-cpp. There's even a demo mode that works without any AI backend."

### If They Ask About Features:
> "Beyond what you saw, there's a template system for common tasks, customizable hotkeys, system tray integration, and we're planning voice input next."

### If They Ask About Tech Stack:
> "Electron for the desktop app, React with TypeScript for the UI, SQLite for history storage, and OpenAI for the AI. All styled with authentic Windows 98 CSS."

### If They Love the Nostalgia:
> "Right?! We spent hours getting those 3D borders perfect. Even the hover effects match the original Windows 98 behavior."

### If They Ask About Use Cases:
> "Perfect for anyone who works with lots of documents - students, writers, developers, researchers. Quick AI assistance without leaving your workflow."
